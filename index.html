        <h2>Backstory:</h2>
        <p>Upon move out, Prestige Property Management (PPM) billed for 15.75 hours of cleaning ($567.00), 3 hours of repairs($273.60, including a $45.17 air filter) &amp; $256.10 for carpet cleaning. In total, they initlally refunded us just $55.80 out of the $2115.00 we put down as our deposit, which wasn't even enough to cover the pro-rated rent refund we were legally entitled to. When negotiating via email to reduce that unfair charges, PPM clearly stated we were overbilled & were entitled to a refund of $606.40. While I personally feel that was still too low, I did settle so as to avoid a drawn out legal battle.</p> 
  
        <p>Unfortunately, there were terms to PPMs settlement. Most of which I was just fine with, but there was a clause written in that prevented me from sharing my experience with them. When asked to remove that &amp; add in some protections for us, PPM declined &amp; refused to issue us a refund. We offered to sign a revised contract, or to proceed with none at all. We were again refused the refund they already agreed to. Ultimately we ended up settling in court. Between their lack of oversight when it comes to handling deposits, and how they treat tenants that they've wronged, I would certainly recommend not renting from PPM. </p>

        <p>If you'd like more information to make an informed decison about renting from PPM, please feel free to download our email correspondence PDF, any of the other documents here, and review the photos using the links for each room above. I've tried to make this documentation so you can view the state of the unit before &amp; after our stay and decide for yourself whether or not we deserved more than $55.80 back from PPM. I've attached our email correspondence, while it's rather lengthy I'd encourage you to read it so you can understand how PPM treats their tenants that they owe hundreds of dollars to. I've tried to highlight important points so you can skim the emails.</p>
